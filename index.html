I. Transportation in Living Organisms  
• Transportation in Plants: Unlike animals, plants require less energy but need a system to move inorganic substances absorbed from the soil.  
  ◦ Water Transport: Occurs through root pressure and transpiration pull.  
  ◦ Food Transport: The movement of food (sucrose) from leaves to other plant parts is called translocation and requires ATP.

II. Excretion in Living Organisms  
• Living organisms produce harmful waste like urea, ammonia, and uric acid that must be removed.  
• Plants excrete through diffusion, shedding leaves/fruits, or storing waste as resins and gums.  
• Human excretory system consists of kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Nephrons filter blood to form urine.  
• Dialysis is used when kidneys fail.

III. Co-ordination in Plants  
• Co-ordination is the regulation of organ systems to maintain homeostasis.  
• Growth-related movements (tropisms) include phototropism, gravitropism, hydrotropism, and chemotropism.  
• Growth-irrelevant movements include immediate responses like closing of Touch-me-not leaves.  
• Plant hormones like auxin, gibberellins, and abscisic acid regulate growth.

IV. Co-ordination in Humans – Nervous System  
• Neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system.  
• Nervous system includes CNS, PNS, and ANS.  
• Reflex action is an immediate involuntary response to a stimulus.

V. Chemical Co-ordination – Endocrine System  
• Endocrine glands release hormones directly into the blood.  
• Major glands include pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, adrenal, ovary, and testis.

  question:
`1. Match the pairs and explain.

‘A’

‘B’

1. Growth towards pollen tube of ovule

Gravitropic movement

2. Growth of shoot system

Chemotropic movement

3. Growth of root system

Phototropic movement

4. Growth towards water

Growth-irrelevant movement


Hydrotropic movement`,
  answer:
`Answer:

1. Growth of pollen tube towards ovule — b. Chemotropic movement
2. Growth of shoot system — c. Phototropic movement
3. Growth of root system — a. Gravitropic movement
4. Growth towards water — e. Hydrotropic movement 

Explanation: Plants exhibit movements in response to specific environmental stimuli. These include chemicals (Chemotropism), light (Phototropism), gravity (Gravitropism), and water (Hydrotropism).`

  question:
`2. Complete the paragraph.

(Using the words: Nerve, muscle cell, impulse, dendrite, synapse, axon, reflex action, cell body)

The milk was on the stove. Rasika was engrossed watching television. She smelled something burning. She ran towards the kitchen. The milk was boiling over. She held the vessel with her bare hands but, screaming, she let it go at once. This activity was controlled by _____ cells. Special ends of _________ in these cells collected the information, from where it was transferred to the _________ and then towards the terminal end of the ______. The chemicals produced at the terminal end passed through the minute space i.e. __________. In this way, _______ were conducted in the body and the process of _________ was completed by conducting the impulses from ________ to _____________.`,
  answer:
`Answer:

The milk was on the stove. Rasika was engrossed watching television. She smelled something burning. She ran towards the kitchen. The milk was boiling over. She held the vessel with her bare hands but, screaming, she let it go at once. This activity was controlled by nerve cells. Special ends of dendrites in these cells collected the information, from where it was transferred to the cell body and then towards the terminal end of the axon. The chemicals produced at the terminal end passed through the minute space i.e. synapse. In this way, impulses were conducted in the body and the process of reflex action was completed by conducting the impulses from nerve to muscle cell.`

  question:
`3. Write notes on-
Root Pressure, Transpiration, Nerve Cell, Human Brain, Reflex action`,
  answer:
`Answer:

Root pressure: This is the pressure exerted by turgid root cells on adjacent cells due to differences in water and mineral concentration between the soil and the roots. This pressure is sufficient to lift water up in small plants and shrubs.

Transpiration: The process by which plants release water in the form of vapor through stomata on their leaves. This creates a transpiration pull that assists in the absorption and distribution of water and minerals to all parts of the plant.

Nerve cell: Also known as neurons, these are the structural and functional units of the nervous system. They are the largest cells in the human body and have the ability to generate and conduct electro-chemical impulses.

Human brain: The main controlling part of the nervous system, located in the cranial cavity. It is divided into regions such as the cerebrum (for memory and voluntary movements), cerebellum (for balance), and medulla oblongata (for involuntary activities like heartbeats).

Reflex action: An immediate, involuntary response to a stimulus from the environment that occurs without conscious thought or the intervention of the brain.`

{
  question:
`4. Name the hormones of the following endocrine glands and the function of each.

Pituitary, Thyroid, Adrenal, Thymus, Testis, Ovary.`,
  answer:
`Answer:

Pituitary: Secretes Growth Hormone (stimulates bone growth), Thyroid stimulating hormone (stimulates thyroid), and Oxytocin (contracts uterus during birth).

Thyroid: Produces Thyroxine (controls body growth and metabolic activities) and Calcitonin (controls calcium metabolism).

Adrenal: Secretes Adrenaline and Non-adrenaline (controls behavior during crisis) and Corticosteroids (maintains Na+ and K+ balance).

Thymus: Produces Thymosin (controls cells that provide immunity).

Testis: Secretes Testosterone (stimulates secondary male sexual characteristics like beard and hoarse voice).

Ovary: Produces Oestrogen (stimulates secondary female characteristics) and Progesterone (prepares the endometrium for pregnancy).`

  question:
`5. Answer the following.

a. Explain chemical co-ordination in humans
b. Explain the difference between the excretory system of humans and plants
c. Explain co-ordination in plants with suitable examples`,
  answer:
`Answer:

a. Explain chemical co-ordination in humans: This is achieved through endocrine glands, which are ductless glands that release hormones directly into the blood. These hormones act as chemical messengers to regulate specific functions, such as the pancreas releasing insulin to regulate blood-glucose levels.

b. Explain the difference between the excretory system of humans and plants: Humans have a specialized, complex system involving kidneys and nephrons to filter blood and remove nitrogenous waste. Plants lack specialized organs; they excrete through diffusion, shedding leaves, or storing waste as resins and gums.

c. Explain co-ordination in plants with suitable examples: Plants coordinate through movements in response to stimuli, such as phototropism (bending toward light) or thigmotropism (tendrils climbing a support). They also use hormones like auxin for cell enlargement and abscisic acid to retard growth.`

{
  question:
`6. Explain in your own words with suitable examples.

a. What is meant by co-ordination?
b. How does excretion occur in human beings?
c. How is excretion in plants useful to human beings?
d. Describe the transportation system in plants`,
  answer:
`Answer:

a. What is meant by co-ordination? It is the systematic regulation of different organ systems and processes so they function in the proper sequence to complete an activity or maintain homeostasis.

b. How does excretion occur in human beings? Blood is filtered in the kidneys by units called nephrons. Waste products like urea are separated to form urine, which travels through ureters to the urinary bladder before being expelled through the urethra.

c. How is excretion in plants useful to human beings? Many plant waste products are valuable materials for humans, such as rubber latex, gum, and resins.

d. Describe the transportation system in plants: Plants use xylem to transport water and minerals upward from the roots, and phloem to transport food (sugar) from the leaves to other parts of the plant via translocation.`

{
  question:
`Analogy for Co-ordination`,
  answer:
`Imagine a musical orchestra where every instrument must play the right note at the exact right time; if one instrument is out of sync, the entire performance fails, much like how the body relies on co-ordination to maintain health.`
